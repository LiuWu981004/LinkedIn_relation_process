Dabbar is CEO and Co-founder of Bohr Quantum Technology, developing and deploying technologies for the emerging quantum internet I am also a Distinguished Visiting Fellow at Columbia University at the Center on Global Energy Policy, and a Fox Business and WSJ editorial page contributor Prior to that, the U.S. Senate unanimously confirmed me as the Dept. of Energy’s fourth Under Secretary for Science. I managed several areas of the Dept., and served as the Dept’s principal advisor on fundamental energy research, energy technologies, science, and commercialization of technologies. I managed over 60,000 people with a budget of $15 billion p.a. at over 100 sites, managing the majority of the U.S. National Labs, including Oak Ridge, Lawrence Berkeley, Stanford SLAC, Princeton Plasma, Argonne, Fermi and Brookhaven National Labs Areas of research I managed included basic energy sciences, nuclear and high energy physics, advanced computing, fusion, and biological & environmental research. I also led the largest environmental remediation program in the world, addressing the operations of nuclear weapons and commercial power, completing several multi-billion dollar construction projects. I also led various new efforts to commercialize innovations arising from the National Labs. I co-led several innovation efforts, including the Energy Storage Grand Challenge, the passage and implementation of the National Quantum Initiative Act and developing the U.S. Quantum Internet Blueprint I was awarded in 2021 the Secretary of Energy’s senior DOE award, the James R. Schlesinger Medal, for leadership on developing energy technologies, discovery science, environmental management, and the National Quantum Initiative I have traveled to both the geographic North and South Poles: to the North Pole by submarine to conduct environmental research while in the Navy, and to the South Pole in support of high energy physics astronomy missions of DOE at South Pole Station Prior to confirmation as Under Secretary, I worked in operations, finance, and strategy roles in the energy and national defense sectors. As Managing Director at J.P. Morgan, I had over $400 billion in transaction experience across all energy sectors. In addition, I had a senior leadership role for the company’s commodity trading business, including energy. Before J.P. Morgan, I was a nuclear submarine officer.

I managed several areas of the Dept., and served as the Dept’s principal advisor on fundamental energy research, energy technologies, science, and commercialization of technologies. I managed over 60,000 people with a budget of $15 billion p.a. at over 100 sites, managing the majority of the U.S. National Labs, including Oak Ridge, Lawrence Berkeley, Stanford SLAC, Princeton Plasma, Argonne, Fermi and Brookhaven National Labs Areas of research I managed included basic energy sciences, nuclear and high energy physics, advanced computing, fusion, and biological & environmental research. I also led the largest environmental remediation program in the world, addressing the operations of nuclear weapons and commercial power, completing several multi-billion dollar construction projects. I also led various new efforts to commercialize innovations arising from the National Labs. I co-led several innovation efforts, including the Energy Storage Grand Challenge, the passage and implementation of the National Quantum Initiative Act and developing the U.S. Quantum Internet Blueprint I was awarded in 2021 the Secretary of Energy’s senior DOE award, the James R.
