{"id":2402911,"text":"Reuse of learnt knowledge is of critical importance in the majority of knowledge-intensive application areas, particularly because the operating context can be expected to vary from training to deployment. In machine learning this is most commonly studied in relation to variations in class and cost skew in classification. While this is evidently useful in many practical situations, there is a clear and pressing need to generalise the notion of operating context beyond the narrow framework of skew-sensitive classification. This project aims to address the challenge of redesigning the entire data-to-knowledge (D2K) pipeline in order to take account of a significantly generalised notion of operating context.

Consistent with their unique national agendas, countries throughout the world began plotting their paths and hurrying their pace. Now, not long after, the race has become a sprint. Despite everything at stake, for most of us AI remains shrouded by a cloud of mystery and misunderstanding. Hidden behind complex technical terms and confused even further by extravagant depictions in science fiction, the realities of AI and its profound implications are hard to decipher, but still crucial to understand.
