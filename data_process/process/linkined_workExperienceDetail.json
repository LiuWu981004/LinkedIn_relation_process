{"text": "ScratchMyBelly.org was founded to save animals from high kill shelters all over the USA and Mexico. Our goal is to help raise funds to rehabilitate the neglected, injured and sick. In addition, we will also help perfectly healthy animals in a partnership with other rescues, in order to find them forever homes. Every year, about 10 million animals are brought to animal shelters across the USA alone, and more than 5 million of those are put to sleep, via euthanasia or gas chamber. It is an average of 10,000 per day! Economically distressed areas and the illusionary mindset that selling puppies will make one rich, are quickly brought to reality with the many costs associated with owning animals. Most back yard breeders just opt to let their animals go to the streets, and have them picked up as strays by animal control, to avoid surrender fees at the shelters. Once the animals are brought to Southern California animal shelters, they are placed on a 72 hour hold, and they are available for one day to adopters and rescues before they are PTS. It is time to end unnecessary killing of innocent animals and to voice against animal cruelty, and especially to care for the ones left to die.", "metadata": "翻译api错误"}
