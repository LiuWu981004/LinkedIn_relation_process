I was impressed by his insightful and creative approaches to technical problems, by his capacity to work both independently and collaboratively when appropriate, and most of all by his determination to tackle large projects—the kind one knows will take years to complete—in a thoughtful and organized manner. Much of our work involved agent-based modeling and simulation. Chris was responsible for several critical contributions, of which two stand out in my mind. First, Chris designed a suite of data-processing and analysis tools to illuminate the dark, inner workings of our model. This was no mean feat. It required him to program in a language with evolving syntax (which is as frustrating as it sounds) and required him to really think about what was happening in the highly non-linear simulation. The effectiveness of the statistical tools he produced is the best evidence possible that Chris understands deeply how to approach analysis of highly complex systems. Second, Chris developed a prototype test-bed for our model which has enabled us to develop the model better than would otherwise have been possible. Despite initial concerns that it might be a distraction from our primary efforts, Chris continued to develop it on his own and it has now proven to be a very valuable asset to our project, validating his original vision and persistence. Throughout our work together, Chris showed he could thrive in a collaborative environment. He documented his work clearly, responded to communications promptly, was always courteous and respectful, accepted criticism easily, and offered constructive criticism of his own. Chris is an excellent candidate and I unreservedly recommend him.']",[''],['']

Si cette annonce est mise en oeuvre, elle permettrait la concentration des forces russes sur l'est de l'#Ukraine afin d'essayer de s'emparer totalement du Donbass et de sécuriser les territoires qui relient le Donbass à la #Crimée (d'où l'importance de s'emparer de Marioupol). Elle permettrait également de mettre l'effort principal sur l'encerclement des troupes ukrainiennes à l'est. Si cette stratégie fonctionnait, elle donnerait au gouvernement russe une raison de légitimer la fin de ses opérations militaires (surtout devant son opinion publique) ou alors de libérer des forces pour les déployer ailleurs afin de continuer d'autres opérations militaires dans le sud (prise d'#Odessa, contrôle des rives de la Mer Noire et lien avec les troupes russes en #Transnistrie) ou au nord #Kiev. Cette #stratégie dépendra de la capacité de la Russie de libérer des forces sur d'autres fronts et/ou d'en générer de nouvelles pour le front est. Evidemment, les Ukrainiens ne vont pas rester passifs et au vue des contre-offensives qu'ils ont déjà lancées dans certaines villes comme Kiev ou Kherson, et de leur résistance contre les troupes russes, on peut s'attendre à ce que les Ukrainiens essaient de repousser les Russes hors de leur frontière.

A ma connaissance, c’est la première fois qu’une vidéo trafiquée, un #deepfake, a été utilisée, lorsqu’une fausse vidéo du président ukrainien, Volodymyr #Zelensky, annonçant la capitulation de l’#armée ukrainienne, a été diffusée.» La #vidéo, de piètre qualité, a été suivie peu après par une fausse vidéo de Vladimir #Poutine annonçant avoir conclu la #paix. «Ces deepfakes peuvent avoir un impact sur certains citoyens, poursuit Jean-Marc Rickli. Et ces technologies se perfectionnent: on se souvient qu’il y a un an des politiciens européens avaient cru s’entretenir sur #Zoom avec Leonid Volkov, bras droit de l’opposant russe Alexeï #Navalny, alors que c’était un faux.» Images manipulées Selon Jean-Marc Rickli, «la suite pourrait être la #manipulation d’images #satellites, avec là aussi l’idée d’influer sur le moral des citoyens, voire des troupes». L’expert note que de manière peu visible le #conflit se joue aujourd’hui en ligne: des ingénieurs ont par exemple publié sur #Twitter les différentes fréquences utilisées par l’armée #russe, afin d’intercepter leurs communications. «Et l’intelligence artificielle ne sert pas qu’à créer des deepfakes: on peut imaginer que rapidement des #armes seront dirigées par de l’intelligence artificielle, avec des conséquences potentiellement désastreuses», avertit Jean-Marc Rickli. NB: il y a controverse par rapport au faux Volkov, certains affirmant que c’était un deepfake, d’autres un imitateur. Des algorithmes sont déjà présents dans des sytèmes d’armes notamment liés à la #surveillance ou dans les #loiterings #munitions dont certaines sont utilisées en Ukraine. #AI #IA #artificialintelligence #intelligenceartificielle #ukrainewar"", 'Quelques commentaires sur le bilan de la #guerre en #Ukraine après le premier mois du début des hostilités dans le journal Le Temps. «Depuis le début de l’invasion, la plus grande surprise est la mauvaise performance de l’#armée #russe. Le plan initial d’un effondrement rapide de l’Ukraine était irréaliste et basé sur des postulats et des #renseignements sur la capacité et la volonté de l’armée et du peuple ukrainiens de se défendre erronés», estime Jean-Marc Rickli, du Geneva Centre for Security Policy. Les attaques de l’armée russe, forcée de changer son fusil d’épaule, sont dispersées et il y a un manque de coordination entre l’#infanterie, les troupes mécanisées, l’#artillerie et l’#aviation, qui n’a toujours pas de maîtrise totale du ciel, selon cet expert. «La #logistique russe n’est pour l’instant pas à la hauteur d’une telle invasion», poursuit-il. D’autant que le dégel et la boue obligent les convois russes à rester sur les routes, à la merci du harcèlement ukrainien et des #armes #antichars fournies par les #Occidentaux. La seconde surprise est l’ampleur de la résistance ukrainienne. Dans la guerre d’usure qui s’installe, le #moral devient de plus en plus important. «Mais la #Russie a réussi à garder l’initiative et peut choisir l’#escalade», met en garde Jean-Marc Rickli. En face, les Occidentaux craignent d’être entraînés dans un conflit direct avec la Russie. Leur prudence est compréhensible face à une #puissance #nucléaire qui brandit cette menace. Mais, selon Jean-Marc Rickli, «cela empêche les Occidentaux de prendre l’initiative et de fixer des limites claires au Kremlin».

Du fait de la nature des opérations militaires des #Occidentaux ces 30 dernières années qui reposaient pour la plupart sur la projection de forces dans le cadre d\'opérations de restoration/maintien de la #paix ou d\'opérations #antiterroristes ou de contre-insurrection, ces armes n\'étaient pas une priorité car la plupart des adversaires n\'avaient pas de forces aériennes et de capacités mécanisées ou alors très restreintes. Les #Européens vont donc devoir réinvestir dans la défense territoriale ce qui va également privilégier les systèmes d\'armes lourdes (mécanisées, navales, aériennes, anti-aériennes, anti-#missiles). Les #drones montrent également leur rôle crucial utilisés comme moyens de #surveillance et ""d\'artillerie aérienne"". Il est également très probable que plus de moyens vont être alloués aux développements d\'armes anti-drones surtout si elles devaient être utilisées en #essaim (#swarm) dans le futur. Du fait de la #digitalisation croissante des systèmes d\'armes, les moyens de guerre électroniques et #cybernétiques auront également une place proéminente. Finalement, cette guerre démontre également le rôle crucial de la #logistique et des approvisionnements en armes. Donc, on verra probablement une augmentation importante des réserves de munitions afin de pouvoir tenir dans la durée. En ce qui concerne les gagnants de ces futurs achats, l\'industrie américaine est bien positionnée du fait de son ancrage très fort notamment dû à la perspective de jouir de la protection américaine par l\'intégration des systèmes d\'armes US (pays de l\'Europe de l\'Est et du #Golfe) mais également des processus d\'interopérabilité qui favorisent Washington (décision d\'achat de l\'Allemagne de #F35 afin de remplir sa mission de #dissuasion #nucléaire notamment en pouvant emporter les bombes B61 qui ne sont compatibles ni avec le #Rafale ou l\'#Eurofighter). Afin de favoriser leur industrie indigène, certains Etats Européens devraient acheter local et inciter leurs alliés à acheter européen (Rheinmetall pour l\'#Allemagne, Thales, #Dassault pour la France par exemple) surtout si l\'#Europe veut acquérir son autonomie stratégique.

Also, attached are images of the 2022 National Defense Strategy fact sheet for your hip pocket. Bottom line takeaway? I think this budget request should be met with resounding support, from all sides, especially given the current state of things. **Although, it will be interesting to see how the inevitable cynicism creeps in and what the complaints become. Anyways, without further ado, some highlights: - The theme is ""integrated deterrence"" (put that down on your buzzword bingo sheets) - $30.7 billion (+4.1%) increase from fiscal year 2022 enacted amount - $130.1 billion for R&D (all-time high) - 65 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters ($11 billion), 2 VIRGINIA class submarines ($7.3 billion), 3,721 Joint Light Tactical Vehicles ($1.1 billion), space & space-based systems ($27.6 billion) - Cyberspace activities ($11.2 billion), 5G ($250 million); interestingly enough artificial intelligence doesn\'t have a dollar sign associated right now. I\'ll unpack why I think that is in a future post. Suffice to say, it\'s a mess to measure - $4.2 billion for the European Deterrence Initiative (includes $300 million in Ukraine assistance) - 4.6% pay raise for military members & $479 million to implement recommendations from the Independent Review Commission on Sexual Assault - $3 billion to address effects of climate change (personal note: yes, it\'s a national security issue) Okay, so these are some key figures up front. Over the coming days, I have no doubt there will be deeper analysis and you should stay on the lookout. However, I do want to make some final points . . . Budgets cannot go up forever. This will demand tradeoffs eventually. The tough choices are not now, they are in the outyears. This budget will create pivot space, but make no mistake, it means very difficult choices are on the horizon. 1) Demand tough choices—demand them of your colleagues, demand them as taxpayers. 2) You have ~three years to prove your innovation, use them wisely. 3) Don\'t get complacent because this scale of money will not exist forever. 4) Leave a better military for the generation behind you. It\'s not about you. The current senior leadership will literally be long gone by the time much of this comes to fruition. Think about tomorrow—sacrifice your personal notoriety & Beltway celeb status in favor of the next generation. It\'s noble—history will remember fondly—we will remember fondly.

Well, machine learning! As a result, people can now interact with a digital projection of ""him"" for the rest of time at museums. All that said, it begs the broader question & discussion of the week: How do you feel about using AI to ""converse"" with the dead? I know, it\'s heavy, but these are worthy discussions in the not-so-future world. On the flip side, how would you feel about having aspects of yourself (to the extent practicable) copied/transcribed to allow family & future generations to interact with ""you?"" Anyways, hopefully there\'s some lively conversation in the comments below. 👇 But either way, fascinating times we live in. #technology #artificialintelligence #innovation #future #futurism', 'Mistakes are not only opportunities in life to learn, but also to punish competition and build a lead. Slow on the uptake? Drive the ball to the paint. This mindset is just as relevant for global competition as it is in the aforementioned basketball athletics reference. Now, insert the below article on the Chinese Communist Party\'s choice to restrict video game usage here. For those who may be unfamiliar, Chinese teens have a SERIOUS gaming addiction. You thought your kids play too much? An article last year stated that half of Chinese youth were nearsighted & their education was negatively impacted by gaming. Chinese media literally likens it to opium (bit of a long history there). That said, obviously everything is Chinese Communist Party propaganda, so it\'s tough to tell what\'s true & what isn\'t. Maybe Xi Jinping just doesn\'t like video games . . . and ironically this crackdown might be the worst \'great power competition\' move ever. That\'s not to say all the restrictions are bad. One of the Chinese bans is on lootboxes (which is digital content you can buy with real money—think of it as essentially gambling). This is how the industry makes outrageous sums of money. The process goes something like this: ""Hey gamer (who might be 10-years-old), here\'s a pink outfit or weapon with unicorns & glitter adorning it (pretending it\'s limited or rare), that\'ll be $1.99 (just click yes with your parent\'s credit card), thank you very much!"" While still practiced in the US, it\'s not allowed in China (and many other European nations) quite the same. The entire industry, from lootboxes, to workplace misconduct, to diversity & inclusion does deserve real scrutiny. I guess that sort of goes for society as a whole nowadays . . . Anyways, there are a few takeaways here. 1) Video games are culture. Seriously, it\'s not going anywhere, and its worth unimaginable sums of dollars. 2) This is an important story worth following. Real global, economic, & personal impact. 3) We\'re exploring murky digital water & robust discussions today inform our future. 4) The world is changing fast. Leaders need to be informed—it\'s past time for a new generation to assume the mantle to deal with stuff like this. 5) This is what great power competition might actually look like in practice. 6) I hope a future headline is: ""Video Game Restrictions Result in Mass Protests; Youth Dismantle Chinese Communist Party in Favor of Democracy."" I\'m kidding . . . mostly 😏 #technology #future #videogames #gamingnews #gaming', ""A splash of color fitting for spring reading. But color is also a pretty interesting topic to dive into. Intrigued? Please read more 👇🌈 Since the dawn of science & philosophy, humans have been attempting to answer questions about how we perceive color. Fun fact: the ancient Greeks didn't even have a word for blue (they basically thought colors consisted of black, white, red, and light). Eventually, however, Newton came along to show us prisms and rainbows. With that, things changed to more science-based explanations about primary colors and waves of light. To this day, our discussion of color is primarily driven by the science of the matter. But indulge me for a moment and imagine a rainbow right now. What do you see? The locations, backgrounds, or other scenery might be different from what I'm imagining, but I have no doubt you are thinking of a multicolor . . . sunlit arc . . . probably high in an open area of sky . . . descending to two distinct ends opposite of one another. Yeah, that's pretty much a rainbow. Now, there are two things that I find interesting about rainbows that people rarely think of. First, two people sharing the seemingly identical experience of a rainbow are actually seeing two entirely different things, even if standing only a few feet or even inches apart. The pattern they see will be the same—it couldn’t be any different—but the rainbow is dependent upon the unique emissions and angles of reflected light entering our eyes. It has no other physical existence. So, the truth is, we might agree with the person next to us that there is one, but the rainbow one person sees is definitionally different than the rainbow another person sees. Secondly, if our human eyes and brains worked any differently than they do, the rainbows we see would look entirely different. In a lecture titled “The Hidden Beauty of Rainbows,” MIT astrophysicist Walter Lewin concluded that those who understand how white light is fragmented into distinguishable, separate bands of light in a rainbow will, when looking at one again, objectively see much more than those who don’t. “Knowledge,” he said, “always adds. Knowledge never distracts. Knowledge is hidden beauty. Your life will never be the same.” And hopefully reading this added a bit to your life. PS a playful reason T-Minus AI is orange is because orange absorbs blue light.

Note: I am not bringing this up to sway opinion in either direction, but simply as objective, historical fact & analysis. 👇 #SupremeCourt #lawandlegislation #ketanjibrownjackson #legal #law"", 'TRUTH TO POWER | You know what line I personally cannot stand? ""Bloom where you are planted."" While the intent is always kind, it\'s generally just a transfer of responsibility back down the proverbial hill. And this ""bloom where you are planted"" mentality seems to be seeping into executive mindset on digital transformation, e.g., AI, DevSecOps, software, etc. Again, noble intent, but humans have been fertilizing soil for 5-6,000 years and it\'s time we do the same in our defense enterprise. Simply put, there are some places where, no matter how great the idea/endeavor is, innovations will not flourish without prerequisite enablers. Let\'s try another analogy real quick . . . It\'s long revered that the Air Force dates back to a couple bicycle mechanics who figured out how to slip the surly bonds of earth. The Wright Brothers are often cited as a core part of our DNA. The Air Force is defined by this tinker & fixer mentality. And, that\'s true—you see it with each new generation of Airmen & Guardians, but the analogy only goes so far. You see, those Wright Brothers had bicycle parts. Wood was available. The Sprocket chain was borrowed from bicycles. The notion of an \'engine\' wasn\'t revolutionary (although credit to them for commissioning a lightweight design). In essence, it was an iteration on a bike—the Wright Brothers had the parts to even make a flying machine. It was a dream within grasp. What does this have to do with digital transformation? Well, lately the executive-level sentiment on digital things is basically, ""I want to see it in action, I\'m tired of buzzwords, I want to focus tactically, I want to see it instead of hear about it."" Which is great, but the soil is not fertilized—there are no \'bicycle\' parts to build the future! So, instead of speaking in analogies, let me be crystal clear. It is NOT a tech problem. It is NOT a servicemember problem. It is NOT a problem the lower levels can address. IT IS A SENIOR LEVEL PROCEDURAL & PRIORITY ISSUE. The buck stops there. The innovators of today cannot magically sprinkle AI, DevSecOps, or *insert your digital project here*. They are not going to suddenly write a programming language for government computers. They don\'t have repositories to share & manage code. They can\'t (technically or contractually) crack open the back end to do data transformations. There are no compilers. They aren\'t being forced to procure commercially. And the list goes on. That litany of problems isn\'t anything other than 1) a senior-level issue, and 2) an achievable fix by that group . . . if it were the focus . . . In closing, this isn\'t intended to just be a Monday morning outcry against the system. It\'s intended to put the conversation where it should be. The tactical choices of today are the strategic decisions for tomorrow meant to be performed by the strategic leaders. We simply cannot grow the technology from thin air. #technology #artificialintelligence #software #leadership #digital']","['Directs operations for the Department of the Air Force flagship artificial intelligence partnership with the MIT Computer Science and AI Laboratory (CSAIL) and MIT Lincoln Laboratory.

The JHTO is excited to be partnering with this great team on this important project. Some of our most innovative ideas and future hypersonics engineers and scientists come from our universities who produce some of the most capable students in the world. Partnering with universities like UT-San Antonio is critical to realizing battlefield dominance and technological superiority over the next decade and beyond. Congrats again!', 'Tonight! I discuss the JHTO and Hypersonics on Government Matters! 8 and 10:30 pm on WJLA 24/7 News', 'Some more of the exciting work the JHTO is funding through our first round of awards with the University Consortium of Applied Hypersonics.', ""Congrats to all the winners! See the press release for the list of winning projects and their lead universities. Many great teams and schools leading and participating in projects. Like I said before, I wish we could have awarded more, but those who did not get awards this time will have plenty of opportunities. Loved the excellent pairing with industry and allied universities in addition to the well thought-out multidisciplinary teams. Appreciate that industry is leaning heavily into this and engaging strategically. We aim not only to develop technology, but to transition engineers who are already thinking about the department's biggest challenges in Hypersonics S&T and technologies to the industrial base and workforce."", ""Our university consortium has become much more real! Our first awards went out. 18 universities are leading teams of 29 universities and 15 industry partners and 3 national labs on these 17 topic areas. We even have participation of top schools in hypersonics in our key ally countries. I know this group will do great work, and we were very impressed with the quality of submissions. I wish we had more money because it was hard at times to choose a winning team. Many great proposals did not get selected. Looking forward to doing it again in a few months! I'll post shortly with the winners when Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station (TEES) puts out their press release."", 'Really exciting news! Too often we get in our own way when the price of not sharing with our closest allies is far higher than anything that could be lost in doing so.
